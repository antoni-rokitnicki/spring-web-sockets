== This Demo
This demo will stand up Spring application service that exposes a reactive WebSocket service through the Spring 5's WebSockets API.
It will demonstrate multicasting events to web sockets.  We will keep this simple, and direct.  Most of the work that I am trying to convey deals with Reactive concepts.

== Problem documentation
Stock ticker will produce values containting it's ticker symbol, and a price.  Provided a client subscribes to a ticker 'symbol' that will ensure any web socket pulls emit just the subscribed entities.
This way, we can have a 1:many (fan out) situation in which each ticker is it's own Supplier.

== WebSocket Server
the server 

== The Client
yes, a client!

= Afterwords
Next stop, Security!
