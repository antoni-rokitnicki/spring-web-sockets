== This Demo
This demo will stand up Spring application service that exposes a reactive WebSocket service through the Spring 5's WebSockets API.
It will demonstrate multicasting flux to web sockets.  We will keep this simple, and direct.  Most of the work that I am trying to convey deals with Reactive concepts.

== Problem documentation
domain 

== WebSocket Server
the server 

== The Client
yes, a client!

= Afterwords
Next stop, Security!
